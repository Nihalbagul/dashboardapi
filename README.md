## Features
- Product list with card layout

- Responsive and colorful UI

## Technologies Used
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite (for development server and build)
- Fetch API for loading `products.json`

## Demo
You can view the live demo of the application here: [Live Demo](#) _(https://dashboardapi-gamma.vercel.app/)_

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:
- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**

### 2. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

### 3. Install dependencies
After cloning the repository, run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
or if you're using yarn:
```bash
yarn install
```

### 4. Running the development server
To start the app in development mode, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start a development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 5. Build the app
To create a production-ready build, run:
```bash
npm run build
```

### 6. Preview the production build
To locally preview the production build, run:
```bash
npm run preview
```

### 7. Deploying the app
The app can be deployed to services like **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or any other static hosting service. Here's how to do it:

#### Deploy to Vercel:
1. Push your code to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
2. Create an account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
3. Import your repository and Vercel will automatically deploy the app.
4. Your app will be live on a Vercel subdomain (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`).

#### Deploy to Netlify:
1. Push your code to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
2. Create an account on [Netlify](https://netlify.com/).
3. Connect your GitHub repository and Netlify will handle the rest.
4. Your app will be live on a Netlify subdomain (e.g., `https://your-app.netlify.app`).

## Fetching Products

The product data is fetched from a local `products.json` file. If hosting, make sure the file is placed in the `public` directory so it can be accessed at the root of your site (`/products.json`).

Example of fetching the products in code:
```javascript
fetch('/products.json')
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => console.log(data))
    .catch((error) => console.error('Error fetching products:', error));
```
